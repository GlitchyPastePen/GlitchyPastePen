# GlitchyPastePen

A code editor with more features than Pastebin, (almost) equivalent of CodePen and smaller than Glitch.

Create simple front-end projects (mainly with HTML, CSS and JS) and display them with instant deployment and hosting.

GlitchyPastePen is still under construction and uses CodeMirror for editor functionality. It uses the default theme, as I've not yet created a suitable theme. Also, several add-ons need to be added to the editor.

I'm still working on a dashboard for users and which all pages should be displayed to users that haven't logged in, and how. 

The link to the live app of this project will be available as soon as the initial update to the projects work.

### Uses
